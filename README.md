# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains C++ based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

## Follow the websites below to add any new data structure/algorithm

## After learning Data Structures and Algorithms, One should Start participating in online contest and do competitative programming.
reference on how to get started with competitative programming:http://sportprogramming.blogspot.com/2014/07/getting-started-with-sport-of.html     

## Want to contribute

### Follow the steps given below

1. Fork, <https://github.com/Imadarshsri/DataStructuresandAlgorithms/>
2. Execute, `git clone https://github.com/Imadarshsri/DataStructuresandAlgorithms/`
3. Change your working directory to `../DataStructuresandAlgorithms`.
4. Execute, `git remote add origin_user https://github.com/<your-github-username>/DataStructuresandAlgorithms/`
5. Execute, `git checkout -b <your-new-branch-for-working>`.
6. Make changes to the code.
7. Execute, `git add .`.
8. Execute, `git commit -m "your-commit-message"`.
9. Execute, `git push origin <your-current-branch>`.
10. Make PR.

That's it, 10 easy steps for your first contribution. For future contributions just follow steps 5 to 10. Make sure that before starting work, always checkout to master and pull the recent changes using the remote `origin` and then start following steps 5 to 10.

See you soon with your first PR. :smile:
